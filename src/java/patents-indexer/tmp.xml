There is a drain valve <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> under the outer tub <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> for draining the washing water outside of the washing machine. A rotation power from a motor <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> mounted on an underside of the outer tub <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is transmitted to a dewatering shaft <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>coupled to the inner tub <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and the washing shaft <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> coupled to the pulsator <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, for rotating the inner tub <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and the pulsator <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. The washing shaft <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and the dewatering shaft <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>are coupled/decoupled by a clutch <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. </paragraph> <paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> There is a tub cover <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> on the outer tub <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, which will be explained with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. The tub cover <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, of substantially an annular form, has an upper surface portion <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>disposed on top both of the outer tub <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and the inner tub <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, a tight fit portion <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>extended in an upper and a lower direction from an end of the upper surface portion <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>for tight fit to an inside surface of the outer tub <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, and a fastening portion <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>projected from the tight fit portion <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>in a substantially vertical direction for being fastened to the outer tub <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> with screws <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The tub cover <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is provided for prevention of noise and overflow of foam as well as prevention of infiltration of foreign matters into a space between the inner tub and the outer tub. </paragraph> <paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The operation of the aforementioned related art pulsator type washing machine will be explained with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>. </paragraph> <paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The washing machine is operative in a washing cycle, a rinsing cycle, and a dewatering cycle, by proceeding through each of which mode in a sequence the washing can be done. In the washing cycle, upon putting the washing machine into operation after placing the laundry in the inner tub <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, the washing water is supplied until it fills to certain levels of the inner tub <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and the outer tub <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. Upon finishing the water supply, the motor <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> makes intermittent rotations in regular and reverse directions in a state the inner tub <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is standstill, that leads the pulsator <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> to rotate in the regular and reverse directions for washing the laundry. That is, the pulsator <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> repeats the regular/reverse direction rotation, to rotate the laundry in of the inner tub <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and to form water circulation, as well. Then, the laundry is washed by the impact from the pulsator <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, the water circulation, friction with the inner tub <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, and softening effect of the detergent, and the like. After proceeding the washing cycle for a preset time period, the drain valve <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> is opened, to drain contaminated washing water to outside of the washing machine. Then, clean washing water is supplied to inside of the inner tub <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, and the pulsator <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is rotated, to make rinsing cycles for a preset number of times. In the dewatering cycle, the inner tub <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is rotated in a high speed together with the pulsator <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> in one direction in a state the washing shaft <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and the dewatering shaft <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>are coupled. Consequently, the washing water is discharged to the outer tub <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> through the washing holes <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, and drained to outside of the washing machine through the drain valve <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. </paragraph> <paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> However, the related art washing machines, making the washing mostly using mechanical energies, of such as pulsator or agitator, is required to have a rotating power of a certain speed for making an adequate washing, that causes entangle of or damage to the laundry. And, the related art washing machine is involved in an increased washing water and detergent consumed during the washing because the washing machine is operative under a state the washing water is filled in the inner tub and the outer tub, as well as an increased overall washing time period due to increased water supply and drain time periods, that are not directly related to the washing time period. </paragraph> <paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, there has been researches for making washing without rubbing the laundry or applying impact to laundry, one of which is the penetration type washing machine. That is, according to what is known, if a relative flow speed of water passing through between textile fibers of the laundry is greater than a certain level, the water can make a washing, without rubbing or twisting the laundry. A washing machine employing such a principle is a penetration type washing machine. In general, as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,191,667, a related art penetration type washing machine is provided with a washing water sprayer for spraying the washing water to the laundry in an inner tub over a required speed, and a separate pump for pumping the washing water to the washing water sprayer. Therefore, the related art penetration type washing machine has problems in that a complicated system and a large sized pump for obtaining a spraying power for the washing are required. Therefore, the related art penetration type washing machine has been mostly used as a supplementary means for the pulsator type washing machine. </paragraph> <paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> And, though JP S51-13416 discloses a washing machine which makes a penetration washing by rotating an inner tub, the washing machine has the following problems. </paragraph> <paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> First, as the inner tub rotates only in one direction, the washing water penetrates a fixed position of the laundry, to cause a wash difference in which a washed portion and a non-washed portion are happened. </paragraph> <paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Second, the only use of penetration washing makes a washing efficiency poor. Because, though the penetration type washing machine can prevent damage to, and entangling of the laundry, in general, the washing efficiency is poor compared to the pulsator type washing machine. </paragraph> <paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Third, since the washing machine fails to provide a guide means for guiding the washing water to an inside surface of the inner tub when the washing water is pumped to an upper portion between the inner tub and the outer tub, and then, circulated into the inner tub, the washing machine has a poor pumping efficiency. </paragraph> <paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Use of a related art tub cover for the penetration type washing machine causes leakage of spray of the washing water. That is, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, since the related art tub cover <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is merely fastened to the outer tub <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> with screws <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, the washing water leaks through gaps between the tight fit portion <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the tub cover <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and the outer tub, and the fastening portion <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>and a top of the outer tub <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. And, a pumped washing water splashes from an inside of the tub cover to outside of the outer tub <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, to generate noise as the splash hits a washing water case, and to deteriorate washing and rinsing performances of the washing machine as the splash causes a loss of the washing water. Moreover, the leaked or splashed washing water to outside of the outer tub <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> wets various electric components of the washing machine, that is liable to cause malfunction or disorder of the washing machine. </paragraph> <paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> The above references are incorporated by reference herein where appropriate for appropriate teachings of additional or alternative details, features and/or technical background. </paragraph> </section> <section> <heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading> <paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> An object of the invention is to solve at least the above problems and/or disadvantages and to provide at least the advantages described hereinafter. </paragraph> <paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, the present invention is directed a penetration type washing machine, a method for controlling the same, and a tub cover for the same that substantially obviates one or more of the problems due to limitations and disadvantages of the related art. </paragraph> <paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> An object of the present invention is to provide a penetration type washing machine, and a method for controlling the same, which has a simple structure and can improve a washing efficiency. </paragraph> <paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Another object of the present invention is to provide a tub cover for use in a penetration type washing machine which can improve a pumping efficiency and a washing efficiency. </paragraph> <paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Additional features and advantages of the invention will be set forth in the description which follows, and in part will be apparent from the description, or may be learned by practice of the invention.

A penetration type washing machine, and a method for controlling the same will be explained with reference to FIGS. <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>A&tilde;<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>C. </paragraph> <paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> Referring to FIGS. <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>A&tilde;<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>C, there is an inner tub <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> having a plurality of washing holes <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> rotatably mounted in an outer tub <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, with a pulsator <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> formed as a unit with the inner tub <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>. There is a fluid balancer <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> provided on a top of the inner tub <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> for balancing the inner tub <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> during rotation. And, there is a tub cover <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> on a top of the outer tub <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> for preventing noise, suppressing foam formation, and guiding the washing. There is a motor <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> for generating a rotation power under the outer tub <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and a drain valve <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight>. The motor <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> is preferably a variable speed motor, with a rotating shaft thereof being directly coupled to a single driving shaft <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> which rotates the inner tub <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> and the pulsator <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> without introduction of additional power transmission device. The aforementioned penetration type washing machine of the present invention facilitates a penetration washing, an agitation washing, and a restoration circulation washing by varying a rotation speed of the motor <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight>. </paragraph> <paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> The operation of the aforementioned penetration type washing machine of the present invention will be explained with reference to FIGS. <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>A&tilde;<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>C. </paragraph> <paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> The penetration type washing will be explained with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</cross-reference>. When the washing machine is put into operation, the motor <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> is rotated in a high speed. Then, the driving shaft <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> connected to the motor <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> is rotated, and the pulsator <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> and the inner tub <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> connected to the driving shaft is also rotated in a high speed. As has been explained in the related art, the penetration washing requires a relative flow speed of the washing water passing through the laundry to be higher than a certain level, and the flow speed should be enough to generate a centrifugal force that can force the washing water to flow from the inner tub to the outer tub and, therefrom to circulate to the inner tub again. When the pulsator <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> and the inner tub <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> is rotated at a high speed, a centrifugal force is generated, to push the laundry in the inner tub <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> to a wall of the inner tub <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>, and to push the washing water in the inner tub <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> to the outer tub <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> through the washing holes <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> in the inner tub <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>, when the washing water penetrates through between textile fabrics of the laundry, thereby making the penetration washing. And, the washing water pushed out to the outer tub <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and the washing water present on a bottom surface of the outer tub <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is pumped upward along a space between the inner tub <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> and the outer tub <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> by the centrifugal force, until the washing water hits the tub cover <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> where the washing water turns a flow direction to flow into the inner tub <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> again. The washing water flowed into the inner tub <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> has a substantially high pressure caused by the centrifugal force coming from the high speed rotation of the inner tub <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>. Therefore, the washing water can apply an impact to the laundry by the pressure from the centrifugal force and a gravity of the washing water, to provide a beating effect to the laundry, that improves a washing efficiency. </paragraph> <paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> In the meantime, as has been explained in the related art, in the case when the inner tub rotates only in one direction, the wash difference is happened in which extents of wash differ depending on portions of the laundry because positions of the laundry are always fixed. Therefore, the inner tub is rotated in a reverse direction after the inner tub is rotated in a regular direction for a preset time period. Then, the laundry pushed to wall of the inner tub is gathered to a center of the inner tub when the inner tub changes its direction of rotation from regular direction to reverse direction, and the laundry is pushed onto the wall again as the inner tub is accelerated. Accordingly, as a position of the laundry through which the washing water penetrates is changed, the wash difference can be prevented. </paragraph> <paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> In the meantime, as has been explained, the penetration type washing machine of the present invention permits, not only the penetration type washing, but also agitation type and restoration circulation washings by changing a speed and a direction of rotation of the motor. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</cross-reference> illustrates an agitation washing process, referring to which the agitation washing process will be explained. </paragraph> <paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> The agitation washing is available by setting the rotation speed to be below a certain level. That is, if the rotation speed of the motor is set to be comparatively low, the pulsator and the inner tub <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> also rotate at a low speed, at which the centrifugal force is dropped unable to push up the washing water between the inner tub <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> and the outer tub <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, but to keep a certain level. And, the laundry pushed to the wall of the inner tub <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> drops down to the bottom of the inner tub <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> to be submerged in the washing water. Under this state, a water circulation caused by rotation of the inner tub <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> and the pulsator <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> facilitates an agitation washing in a principle identical to a related art pulsator type washing machine. The availability of the penetration washing as well as the agitation washing can provide an excellent washing efficiency. </paragraph> <paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</cross-reference> illustrates a section showing a restoration circulation washing process, referring to which the restoration circulation process will be explained. </paragraph> <paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> If the inner tub <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> which is rotating at a high speed in a penetration washing is stopped or has a speed dropped, the laundry pushed to the inside wall of the inner tub <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> by an inertia is gathered to a central portion of the inner tub <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> to hit one another. That is, the hitting among the laundry or with the pulsator <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> can make washing. In this instance, for conduction of the restoration circulation washing, though the rotating inner tub <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> may be stopped, the restoration circulation washing is available without a separate restriction. Because the inner tub repeats regular and reverse rotations in the penetration washing, the restoration circulation washing is automatically and continuously made whenever the direction of rotation is changed. </paragraph> <paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> Upon completion of the penetration washing, the agitation washing, and the restoration circulation washing, a dewatering cycle is conducted. And, upon completion of the dewatering cycle, a water re-supply process is conducted to conduct a following rinsing process. Though the penetration type washing machine of the present invention may only carry out the penetration type washing, it is preferable that the penetration type washing machine carry out an appropriate combination of the penetration type washing, an agitation type washing and a restoration circulation washing depending on an extent of contamination and an amount of the laundry. And, as has been explained, one washing cycle or a rinsing cycle may be divided into small intervals for repeating the penetration washing and the agitation washing in the intervals, or different from this, it is also possible that re-water supply is made to conduct the agitation washing after completion of the penetration washing. </paragraph> <paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> Advantages of the penetration type washing machine and a method for controlling the same of the present invention will be explained. </paragraph> <paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> As the penetration type washing machine of the present invention makes the penetration type washing mostly, entangling of, and damage to the laundry is reduced compared to the pulsator type washing machine. The re-supply of the washing water into the inner tub in the penetration type washing facilitates consumption of less washing water, with use of less detergent, and faster washing water supply and drain, that minimizes waste of time in the supply and drain of the washing water. Moreover, the washing water in the outer tub do nothing but interferes the rotation of the inner tub <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> in the pulsator type washing machine because the washing water in the outer tub generates a friction when the inner tub is rotated even though the washing water in the inner tub act an important role as the washing water in the inner tub is brought into contact with the laundry to make washing. Therefore, in order to make a smooth rotation, it is important for the inner tub to make a less contact with the washing water in the outer tub as far as possible. By the way, the penetration type washing machine of the present invention has a small amount(approx. 50%) of washing water supplied to the inner tub and the outer tub, and the washing water is pumped into the inner tub again in conducting the washing. That is, as the outer tub has less amount of washing water, rotation of the inner tub is smoother. Different from the related art penetration type washing machine, the penetration type washing machine has a simple system as no separate pumping device are required, and facilitates a satisfactory washing efficiency while preventing entangling of, or damage to the laundry by an appropriate combination of the penetration washing, the agitation washing and the restoration circulation washing. The penetration type washing machine of the present invention has the washing water in the inner tub <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> pumped up to the top portion thereof through a space between the inner tub <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> and the outer tub <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> at a substantially high pressure, to be recirculated into the inner tub <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>. Consequently, the high pressure of the washing water pumped upward may cause leakage if the related art tub cover is used as it was. Though this leakage may be prevented by providing gasket on a top surface of the outer tub <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, accurate fitting of the gasket to a large diametered outer tub <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is not practicable. Therefore, it is preferable that the tub cover structure of the penetration type washing machine is changed, appropriately. The tub cover of the present invention will be explained. </paragraph> <paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> A first embodiment tub cover of the present invention will be explained with reference to FIGS. <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>&tilde;<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. The first embodiment tub cover is substantially identical to the one of the related art except that a leakage prevention means is additionally provided in the first embodiment tub cover. </paragraph> <paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> That is, similar to the related art tub cover, the first embodiment tub cover <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> includes an upper surface portion <highlight><bold>411</bold></highlight>, a tight fit portion <highlight><bold>413</bold></highlight>, and a fastening portion <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight>. However, different from the related art, the fastening portion <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight> has a downward projection at an approx. center thereof in parallel to the tight fit portion <highlight><bold>413</bold></highlight>, and there is a slot on a top portion of the outer tub <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> for insertion of the projection <highlight><bold>415</bold></highlight> thereto. And, there is a sealing member <highlight><bold>417</bold></highlight> in a space formed between the tight fit portion <highlight><bold>413</bold></highlight> and the projection <highlight><bold>415</bold></highlight> for prevention of leakage. </paragraph> <paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> And, referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5, a</cross-reference> length of the projection <highlight><bold>415</bold></highlight> may be formed shorter, for providing the sealing member <highlight><bold>417</bold></highlight> in a space formed below the projection <highlight><bold>415</bold></highlight>. </paragraph> <paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> And, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, the sealing member may be disposed on a top end of the outer tub <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. In detail, as the sealing member <highlight><bold>417</bold></highlight> is fitted to the top end of the outer tub <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, a support <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is projected in an outward radial direction of the outer tub <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> from a portion below the top end portion <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the outer tub <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. And, a horizontal portion <highlight><bold>441</bold></highlight> is formed at an outer circumference of the upper surface portion <highlight><bold>411</bold></highlight> of the tub cover <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>, with an end of the horizontal portion <highlight><bold>441</bold></highlight> bent downward, to form a tight fit portion <highlight><bold>413</bold></highlight> which fit to an inside surface of the support <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>in the outer tub <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, without providing the fastening portion. And, in order to make the assembly easy, the sealing member <highlight><bold>417</bold></highlight> is preferably attached to the horizontal portion <highlight><bold>441</bold></highlight> of the tub cover with adhesive <highlight><bold>452</bold></highlight>. And, it is preferable that a position the support <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>in the outer tub <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is projected is to be below the top end of the outer tub <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, to provide a space between the top end <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the outer tub <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and the support <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. Because if leakage of the washing water is happened despite of the sealing member <highlight><bold>417</bold></highlight>, the leakage of washing water may be collected in the space. The washing water collected in the space is drained using overflow hose(not shown) connected to an air vent hose. The first embodiment tub cover can prevent leakage of the washing water even if the washing water is pumped to the tub cover <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> at a high pressure by means of the sealing member <highlight><bold>417</bold></highlight>. And, as the fitting of the tub cover <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> to the outer tub <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> only requires insertion of the projection <highlight><bold>415</bold></highlight> at the tub cover to the slot in the outer tub <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, the assembly is simple. And, as the slot serves as a guide, for accurate fitting of the tub cover <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> to the outer tub <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, preventing vibration during operation of the washing machine. </paragraph> <paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> In the meantime, even if the first tub cover <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> can prevent leakage of the washing water, neither spray of the washing water caused by hitting the tub cover can be prevented, nor an exact guide of the washing water into the inner tub <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> is possible. Therefore, the following second to seventh embodiments tub covers of the present invention will provide improved tub covers. The second embodiment tub cover will be explained with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</cross-reference>. </paragraph> <paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> The second embodiment tub cover <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> includes an upper tub cover <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> fastened to the outer tub <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, and a lower tub cover <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> mounted under the upper tub cover <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> with a space therefrom, wherein there are washing water guide passages P<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and P<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> formed between the upper and lower tub covers. The upper tub cover <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> has a substantially annular form of an upper surface portion <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight>, a tight fit portion <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> projected from an outer end of the upper surface portion <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight> vertically for tight fit to an inside wall of the outer tub <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, and a fastening portion <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight> extended from the tight fit portion <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> in a horizontal direction for fastening to a top end of the outer tub, forming an &ldquo;L&rdquo; section, substantially. The lower tub cover <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> has an upper surface portion <highlight><bold>221</bold></highlight>, and a vertical portion <highlight><bold>225</bold></highlight> projected downward from an outer end of the upper surface portion <highlight><bold>221</bold></highlight>, with a plurality of reinforcing brackets <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight> connected between the upper surface portion and the vertical portion. There are a plurality of height adjustment members <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> formed at fixed intervals. In order to couple the upper tub cover <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> to the lower tub cover <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight>, it is preferable that the height adjustment members <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> have a female thread <highlight><bold>223</bold></highlight>, and the upper surface portion <highlight><bold>221</bold></highlight> of the upper tub cover <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> has a plurality of fastening holes <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> formed at positions corresponding to the height adjustment members <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight>. </paragraph> <paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8, a</cross-reference> fastened state will be explained. The upper tub cover <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> and the lower tub cover <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> are fastened with screws <highlight><bold>213</bold></highlight>, and the upper tub cover <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> is fastened to a top end of the outer tub <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> with screws. Therefore, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, the washing water pumped to the tub cover <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is guided by the guide passage P<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and P<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> between the upper tub cover and the lower tub cover, to guide the washing water into the inner tub <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> smoothly, which improves a pumping efficiency. And, the spray of the washing water can be prevented. And, a pressure of the washing water sprayed to the inner tub <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> from the tub cover <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is adjustable by adjusting a space S between the upper tub cover and the lower tub cover, i.e., a height of the height adjustment member <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight>. By the way, there is a possible leakage through a gap between the fastening holes in the upper tub cover <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> and the screws in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>. Therefore, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, it is preferable that height adjustment members <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>are formed on the upper tub cover <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>, and pass-through holes are formed in the lower tub cover <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight>. Because the washing water flowing from the tub cover <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> to the inner tub <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> advances in a tangential direction of an inside diameter of the inner tub <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> by the centrifugal force. </paragraph> <paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> A tub cover having modified such drawback is the third embodiment tub cover, which will be explained with reference to FIGS. <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>&tilde;<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. </paragraph> <paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> The third embodiment tub cover <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> includes an upper surface portion <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> and a tight fit portion <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight>, and there are a plurality of deflectors <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> on an underside of the upper surface portion <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> for deflecting a flow direction of the washing water. The deflector <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> is fitted in a radial direction for deflecting the washing water advancing in a tangential direction to a center direction. There are a plurality of deflectors fitted as fixed intervals to divide the flow paths. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>, this structure permits the washing water pumped and flowed into the tub cover <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> hits the deflectors <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>, to change a direction of flow toward, not the tangential direction, but the center direction, substantially. And, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>, there may be a guide rib <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight> on the deflector <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> for reducing a friction of the washing water. And, a plate drop preventor <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight> may preferably be fitted at a bottom of the deflector <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> for preventing drop of the washing water, flowing into the tub cover, into a space between the inner tub <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> and the outer tub <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> by gravity, but to be supplied to the inner tub <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>. Of course, the drop preventor <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight> may be provided with a larger area or the lower tub cover of the second embodiment may be provided. And, the height adjustment members <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>in the second embodiment may be formed to have forms of the deflectors <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>, for combined use of the height adjustment members <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>as the deflectors. </paragraph> <paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> Because outlets of the washing water passages P<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are substantially horizontal in the first to third embodiments tub covers, the washing water flows out substantially in the horizontal direction. Opposite to this, the following fourth to seventh embodiment tub covers are provided with an adjustable spray angle, with a convenience of assembly. </paragraph> <paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> The fourth embodiment tub cover will be explained with reference to FIGS. <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>&tilde;<highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. </paragraph> <paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> Alike the second embodiment tub cover, the fourth embodiment tub cover also include an upper tub cover <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight> and a lower tub cover <highlight><bold>503</bold></highlight> for forming a washing water passage. The upper tub cover <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight> has an upper surface portion <highlight><bold>521</bold></highlight>, a tight fit portion <highlight><bold>522</bold></highlight>, and a fastening portion <highlight><bold>523</bold></highlight>, and the lower tub cover <highlight><bold>503</bold></highlight> also has an upper surface portion <highlight><bold>512</bold></highlight> and a vertical portion <highlight><bold>511</bold></highlight>, except that there are a plurality of guide members <highlight><bold>505</bold></highlight> fitted at fixed intervals provided between the upper tub cover and the lower tub cover for combined use as the height adjustment members and the deflectors in the aforementioned embodiments. The guide member <highlight><bold>505</bold></highlight> is preferably formed extended from inlet to outlet of the flow passage to cover the entire washing water passage. In this embodiment, the horizontal passage P<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is formed to direct a lower portion of the inner tub <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>, and the upper tub cover <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight> and the lower tub cover <highlight><bold>503</bold></highlight> are provided with downward curvatures to provide a stream lined horizontal passage P<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> for minimize a friction. The lower tub cover <highlight><bold>503</bold></highlight> is mounted spaced from the fluid balancer <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> by a preset distance T1, with a chamfer <highlight><bold>507</bold></highlight> in the fluid balancer <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> to suit to a contour of the passage P<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. Because this configuration can prevent bumping between the fluid balancer <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> and the tub cover <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight>. And, in order to prevent bumping between the fluid balancer <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> and the outer tub <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight>, a second gap T2 formed between the fluid balancer <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> and the outer tub <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> may be further provided. The distance T1 is preferably identical to the gap T2 between the fluid balancer <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> and the outer tub <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, substantially. </paragraph> <paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> A fastening structure of the fourth embodiment tub cover of the present invention will be explained with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference>. </paragraph> <paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> Alike the previous embodiment, if the upper tub cover, the guide member and the lower tub cover are fastened with screws, the washing water may leak. Therefore, it is preferable that the upper tub cover <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight>, the guide members <highlight><bold>505</bold></highlight> and the lower tub cover <highlight><bold>503</bold></highlight> are fabricated separately and jointed them together by means of welding and the like. Of course, it is possible that either the upper tub cover <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight> and the guide members <highlight><bold>505</bold></highlight> may be fabricated as a unit, to which the lower tub cover <highlight><bold>503</bold></highlight> is welded, or the lower tub cover <highlight><bold>503</bold></highlight> and the guide members <highlight><bold>505</bold></highlight> may be fabricated as a unit, to which the upper tub cover <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight> is welded. In this instance, for the sake of convenience of assembly and preventing projection of the upper tub cover <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight> to an outward radial direction, there is a stepped portion <highlight><bold>532</bold></highlight> at one side of the lower tub cover <highlight><bold>503</bold></highlight> for catching a bottom end of the upper tub cover <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference>, fastening with screws is also possible, particularly, fastening the lower tub cover <highlight><bold>503</bold></highlight> to the guide member <highlight><bold>505</bold></highlight> with screws <highlight><bold>534</bold></highlight> is effective in view of leakage prevention. Similar to the previous embodiments, this embodiment tub cover serves for a smooth guidance of the washing water, prevention of spray, and prevention of leakage. In addition to this, this embodiment tub cover can further improve a pumping performance and washing performance because the washing water passage is streamlined with a preset curvature, which minimizes a loss caused by friction to guide the washing water into a lower portion of the inner tub <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> effectively. By the way, in this embodiment, fore ends of the upper tub cover <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight> and the lower tub cover <highlight><bold>503</bold></highlight>, i.e., a width W of an outlet of the washing water may be adjusted for adjusting the pressure of the washing water. That is, the more the width W of the outlet of the washing water is reduced, the higher the pressure of the washing water. The width W may preferably be adjusted by decreasing or increasing a fore end of the upper tub cover <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight> by an angle &thgr; toward a fore end direction of the lower tub cover <highlight><bold>503</bold></highlight>. And, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 20 and 21</cross-reference>, the fore end of the upper tub cover <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight> may be extended or shortened with respect to the fore end of the lower tub cover <highlight><bold>503</bold></highlight>, for adjusting an angle of spray of the washing water. That is, if the fore end of the upper tub cover is shortened by a distance H1 with respect to the fore end of the lower tub cover <highlight><bold>503</bold></highlight>, the washing water is sprayed upward, and extended by a distance H2, sprayed downward. In conclusion, this embodiment allows an appropriate adjustment of the spray pressure and the spray angle. And, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23, a</cross-reference> radius R1 formed by the fore end of the upper tub cover <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight> and a radius R<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> formed by the fore end of the lower tub cover <highlight><bold>503</bold></highlight> may preferably be made different, to improve a washing water supply efficiency. </paragraph> <paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> In the meantime, as the guide members <highlight><bold>505</bold></highlight> are not curved, the washing water is adapted to hit the guide member <highlight><bold>505</bold></highlight> as a right angle, to cause a friction and a consequential reduction of a pumping efficiency. And, the abrupt change of the flow direction of the washing water causes noise coning from impact. And, because the third embodiment tub cover has the deflectors fitted perpendicular to the washing water flow, a portion of the washing water hit onto the deflector turns a flow direction, not to the inner tub, but backwardly opposite to the flow direction of the washing water due to a reaction force. And, a vortex may be occurred in a space formed by an outer circumference of the deflector and the tight fit portion. Those are causes of dropping the pumping efficiency. Accordingly, the following embodiment is a modification for improving such problems. </paragraph> <paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> The fifth embodiment tub cover is the one in which those disadvantages are improved, which will be explained with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</cross-reference>. </paragraph> <paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> The guide member <highlight><bold>505</bold></highlight> of this embodiment is formed to have a curvature, for guiding the washing water smoothly with a minimum friction at the guide member <highlight><bold>505</bold></highlight>. As the inner tub <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> rotates in regular and reverse directions, it is preferable that regular direction guide members <highlight><bold>505</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and reverse direction guide members <highlight><bold>505</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are provided, respectively. Because others are the same with the fourth embodiment, the explanation will be omitted. According to this, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</cross-reference>, since the washing water pumped by high speed rotation of the inner tub <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> is supplied to the inner tub <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> smoothly with a minimum friction, the pumping efficiency can be improved. However, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</cross-reference>, if the regular direction guide members <highlight><bold>505</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and the reverse direction guide members <highlight><bold>505</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are integrated, a fore end <highlight><bold>505</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>has no curvature, which has a great friction. Therefore, the fore end <highlight><bold>505</bold></highlight> also need to have a curvature, preferably. To do this, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</cross-reference>, the regular direction guide members <highlight><bold>505</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and the reverse direction guide members <highlight><bold>505</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are preferably provided with curvatures throughout entire lengths, with the fore ends thereof connected with a curved portion <highlight><bold>507</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>. Thus, since the washing water pumped during a regular direction rotation of the inner tub <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> is guided by the regular direction guide member <highlight><bold>507</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, with a reduced friction, and the washing water pumped during a reverse direction rotation of the inner tub <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> is guided by the reverse direction guide member <highlight><bold>507</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, with a reduced friction, the curved members <highlight><bold>507</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>507</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>can improve the pumping efficiency. </paragraph> <paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> In the meantime, even though the aforementioned tub covers of the present invention can prevent spray of the washing water effectively, once sprayed, the sprayed washing water flows to outside of the outer tub <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. Therefore, the following sixth embodiment tub cover is provided for an effective prevention of spray to outside of the outer tub <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. The sixth embodiment tub cover will be explained with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</cross-reference>. </paragraph> <paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> Similar to the fourth and fifth embodiment tub covers, the sixth embodiment tub cover <highlight><bold>700</bold></highlight> includes an upper tub cover <highlight><bold>701</bold></highlight> and a lower tub cover <highlight><bold>703</bold></highlight> each having a curvature, and a guide members <highlight><bold>705</bold></highlight>. And, the upper tub cover <highlight><bold>701</bold></highlight> has an upper surface portion <highlight><bold>714</bold></highlight>, a tight fit portion <highlight><bold>715</bold></highlight> and a fastening portion <highlight><bold>711</bold></highlight>. The lower tub cover <highlight><bold>703</bold></highlight> also has an upper surface portion <highlight><bold>722</bold></highlight> and a vertical portion <highlight><bold>721</bold></highlight>. However, in this embodiment, the tight fit portion <highlight><bold>715</bold></highlight> of the upper tub cover <highlight><bold>701</bold></highlight> is projected upward to form a projection <highlight><bold>715</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, to form a recess <highlight><bold>712</bold></highlight> between an outer circumference and the projection <highlight><bold>715</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, to collect the sprayed washing water. Then, the washing water collected in the recess <highlight><bold>712</bold></highlight> is drained into the inner tub <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> by washing water drain means <highlight><bold>720</bold></highlight>. The washing water drain means <highlight><bold>720</bold></highlight> is sloped flow passages <highlight><bold>713</bold></highlight> recessed in the upper surface of the upper tub cover at fixed intervals, with walls <highlight><bold>713</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>713</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>on both sides of the passage <highlight><bold>713</bold></highlight>. The sloped flow passage <highlight><bold>713</bold></highlight> is sloped inward downwardly. </paragraph> <paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, the guide member <highlight><bold>705</bold></highlight> may only be provided on the vertical flow passage <highlight><bold>705</bold></highlight>, because the walls <highlight><bold>713</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>713</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the sloped flow passages <highlight><bold>713</bold></highlight> act as the guide members in the horizontal flow passage P<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</cross-reference>, the washing water sprayed and collected in the recess <highlight><bold>712</bold></highlight> of the upper tub cover <highlight><bold>701</bold></highlight> flows into the inner tub <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> along the sloped flow passage <highlight><bold>713</bold></highlight>. And, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</cross-reference>, the pumped washing water flows to the inner tub <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> through the flow passages formed between the upper tub cover <highlight><bold>701</bold></highlight> and the lower tub cover <highlight><bold>703</bold></highlight>, when the walls <highlight><bold>713</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>713</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>divide the passage. The walls <highlight><bold>713</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>713</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are formed with curvatures for guiding the washing water with a reduced friction in correspondence to the regular and reverse rotation. </paragraph> <paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> The washing water drain means may be as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. That is, a plurality of drain holes <highlight><bold>725</bold></highlight> are formed in the recess of the upper tub cover <highlight><bold>701</bold></highlight> at fixed intervals. And, guide members for guiding the washing water into the inner tub <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> from the drain holes <highlight><bold>725</bold></highlight> are preferably provided in the lower tub cover <highlight><bold>703</bold></highlight>. Because if there are no guide members, the washing water drained through the drain holes will flow the space between the inner tub <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> and the outer tub <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> again, to resist against the circulation of the washing water as the lower tub cover <highlight><bold>703</bold></highlight> also has a curvature. The guide member has one pair of walls <highlight><bold>726</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>727</bold></highlight> formed vertical to the upper surface of the lower tub cover <highlight><bold>703</bold></highlight> at a width slightly greater than the width of the discharge hole <highlight><bold>725</bold></highlight> and a sloped passage <highlight><bold>728</bold></highlight> connecting the walls <highlight><bold>726</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>727</bold></highlight> and sloped downwardly in an inner radial direction. The walls <highlight><bold>726</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>727</bold></highlight> also serve as the height adjustment member. And, a front portion <highlight><bold>723</bold></highlight> with a supply hole <highlight><bold>724</bold></highlight> may be provided in front of the walls <highlight><bold>726</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>727</bold></highlight>. </paragraph> <paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> The operation of this embodiment tub cover will be explained. The pumped washing water is collected in the recess <highlight><bold>712</bold></highlight> of the upper tub cover <highlight><bold>701</bold></highlight>. The washing water collected in the recess <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight> flows into the lower tub cover <highlight><bold>703</bold></highlight> through the drain holes <highlight><bold>725</bold></highlight>, and into the inner tub <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> along the sloped passage <highlight><bold>728</bold></highlight>. Thus, spray of the washing water out of the outer tub <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> can be prevented. In the meantime, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>, it is, of course, possible that the upper surface of the upper tub cover <highlight><bold>701</bold></highlight> is provided with a slope &agr; without the washing water drain means, for natural flow of the washing water sprayed to the upper tub cover <highlight><bold>701</bold></highlight> into the inner tub <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> along the upper surface of the upper tub cover <highlight><bold>701</bold></highlight>. In this instance, it is preferable that the guide member <highlight><bold>705</bold></highlight> is extended to the horizontal passage, i.e., to form a vertical portion <highlight><bold>705</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and a horizontal portion <highlight><bold>705</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight></paragraph> <paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> The second to sixth embodiment tub covers have complicated structures and high cost because the tub covers include the upper tub covers, the lower tub covers and guide members, which are comparatively many components that is difficulty in assembly. Therefore, the following seventh and eighth embodiment tub covers provide tub covers which have simple structures but have effects the same with the aforementioned embodiments. Different from the foregoing second to sixth tub covers, the following embodiment tub covers have one single tub cover(corresponding to an upper tub cover in the related art). And, different from the first embodiment tub cover, these embodiment tub covers are provided with means on a bottom surface of the tub cover for guiding the washing water into the inner tub. The pumped washing water can be guided into the inner tub only using a tub cover corresponding to an upper tub cover without using a lower tub cover owing to the following reason. The penetration washing requires fast running of the motor for pumping the washing water. That is, in the penetration washing, the washing water should be pumped upwardly to move upward to overcome a gravity of the washing water itself Therefore, as the washing water pumped toward the tub cover does not fall down even if the lower tub cover is used substantially, formation of the washing water passage is possible even if no lower tub cover is used. And, in the case of agitating washing, since the washing water is not circulated and the tub cover only serves for prevention of noise, and foam reduction, the lower tub cover may be dispensed with, too. The seventh embodiment tub cover will be explained in detail with reference to FIGS. <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. </paragraph> <paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> The seventh embodiment tub cover <highlight><bold>800</bold></highlight> includes a tight fit portion <highlight><bold>810</bold></highlight> for tight fit on an inside surface of a top end of the outer tub, an upper surface portion <highlight><bold>811</bold></highlight> extended upwardly from the tight fit portion <highlight><bold>810</bold></highlight> at an angle for serving as a guide for the washing water, and a fastening portion <highlight><bold>810</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>projected from the tight fit portion <highlight><bold>810</bold></highlight> in a horizontal direction for being fastened to the outer tub with screws. The upper surface portion <highlight><bold>811</bold></highlight> may preferably have a curvature, rather than at a right angle to the tight fit portion <highlight><bold>810</bold></highlight> for reducing friction with the washing water. And, there is a vertical deflector <highlight><bold>813</bold></highlight> formed downwardly at a fore end of the upper surface portion <highlight><bold>811</bold></highlight> for downward guide of the washing water to a lower portion of the inner tub, and preferably there is a vertical protector <highlight><bold>811</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>on an outer circumference of the upper surface portion <highlight><bold>811</bold></highlight> for protecting the spray of the washing water to outside of the outer tub. There are a plurality of main deflectors <highlight><bold>812</bold></highlight> formed on an underside of the upper surface portion <highlight><bold>811</bold></highlight> at fixed intervals, for deflecting a direction of the washing water pumped to the tub cover to a center direction of the inner tub. The main deflector <highlight><bold>812</bold></highlight> is formed to connect an inner and an outer diameters of the upper surface portion of the tub cover, with an angle &thgr;1 to a radial direction of the tub cover. And, supplementary deflectors <highlight><bold>814</bold></highlight> may be further provided for smoother guide of the washing water. The supplementary deflector <highlight><bold>814</bold></highlight> has a fore end started from the inner diameter, extended along a concentric circle with the tub cover substantially, and an aft end ended at a position of the main deflector <highlight><bold>812</bold></highlight>. In this instance, the fore end of the supplementary deflector is preferably spaced from the fore end of the main deflector <highlight><bold>812</bold></highlight> by a preset distance L2. Therefore, the tub cover <highlight><bold>800</bold></highlight> is divided by the main deflectors <highlight><bold>812</bold></highlight> by fixed intervals S, wherein a space between the intervals S has a main flow passage W<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> formed by the main deflector <highlight><bold>812</bold></highlight> and the supplementary deflector <highlight><bold>814</bold></highlight> and a supplementary passage W<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> formed by the supplementary deflector <highlight><bold>814</bold></highlight> and the vertical deflector <highlight><bold>813</bold></highlight>. </paragraph> <paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> The operation of this embodiment will be explained. </paragraph> <paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> The washing water pumped to the tub cover <highlight><bold>800</bold></highlight> is guided by the tub cover <highlight><bold>800</bold></highlight> into the inner tub with a minimum friction. In detail, the washing water risen upwardly is brought in contact with a bottom surface of the tub cover <highlight><bold>800</bold></highlight>. Then, the washing water is guided by the main deflectors <highlight><bold>812</bold></highlight> and the supplementary deflectors <highlight><bold>814</bold></highlight> to deflect a flow direction from a tangential direction to a center direction of the inner tub. And, the washing water having a direction changed by the main passage W<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> formed by the main deflector <highlight><bold>812</bold></highlight> and the supplementary deflector <highlight><bold>814</bold></highlight> hits onto the vertical deflector <highlight><bold>813</bold></highlight> again, to deflect a flow direction from horizontal to vertical downwardly, to supply the washing water to the inner tub lower portion. Most of the pumped washing water is guided by the main flow passages to be sprayed into the inner tub <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>, while a portion of the pumped washing water flows into the inner tub <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> directly from the supplementary flow passage W<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. Because most of the pumped washing water is guided by the main flow passages and the outlet P of each main passage W<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> has a small width L2 and a limited number, that built up a pressure of the washing water, the washing water is intensely sprayed from the outlets, to improve the washing efficiency. In comparison to this, in the related art, since the washing water is sprayed from an entire inner diameter of the tub cover, the washing efficiency is poor because the spraying pressure is dispersed. Though the washing water flowed in a horizontal direction and hit onto the vertical deflector <highlight><bold>813</bold></highlight> turns its flow direction downwardly into the inner tub, a portion of the washing water is scattered by the impact of the hit. However, this embodiment tub cover can minimize scattering of the washing water, generation of noise, and foam formation because the washing water hits the supplementary deflector <highlight><bold>814</bold></highlight> before the washing water hits the vertical deflector <highlight><bold>813</bold></highlight>. And, the washing water still scattered is prevented from leaking beyond an outer wall of the outer tub <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> by the projection <highlight><bold>811</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>on the tub cover <highlight><bold>800</bold></highlight>. And, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 37A, a</cross-reference> damping member <highlight><bold>815</bold></highlight> may preferably be provided at the outlet P side of the main passage W<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, so that the washing water hits the damping member <highlight><bold>815</bold></highlight> beforehand, for effective prevention of the scattering of the washing water occurred when the washing water hits the vertical deflectors <highlight><bold>813</bold></highlight>. The damping member <highlight><bold>815</bold></highlight> is disposed substantially perpendicular to a flow direction of the washing water, i.e., connected from a fore end of the supplementary deflector <highlight><bold>814</bold></highlight> to a fore end of the main deflector <highlight><bold>812</bold></highlight>, with a height lower than heights of the main deflector <highlight><bold>812</bold></highlight> and the supplementary deflector <highlight><bold>814</bold></highlight>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 37</cross-reference>B, instead of the damping member, a sloped portion <highlight><bold>817</bold></highlight> may be provided at an outlet P of the main flow passage. </paragraph> <paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> The following eighth embodiment tub cover is a modification from the seventh embodiment tub cover to suit to a case of both direction, i.e., regular and reverse direction rotation of the inner tub <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>. An overall structure of the eighth embodiment tub cover will be explained with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>. </paragraph> <paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> Alike the seventh embodiment tub cover, the eighth embodiment tub cover <highlight><bold>800</bold></highlight> of the present invention also includes the main deflectors, the supplementary deflectors, and the vertical deflectors, except that first main deflectors <highlight><bold>812</bold></highlight> and second main deflectors <highlight><bold>812</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>are provided in correspondence to the both direction rotation, and a structure of the supplementary deflectors <highlight><bold>814</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is modified. In detail, the first main deflectors <highlight><bold>812</bold></highlight> are formed on an underside of the upper surface portion of the tub cover <highlight><bold>800</bold></highlight> at fixed intervals, and the second deflectors <highlight><bold>812</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>are formed in symmetry to the first main deflectors <highlight><bold>812</bold></highlight>. And, a fore end of the supplementary deflector <highlight><bold>814</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>has a fore end started from the inner circumference and extended along a concentric circle of the tub cover, and an aft end connected to the inner circumference of the tub cover. That is, the fore end of the supplementary deflector <highlight><bold>814</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is positioned spaced from the fore end of the first main deflector <highlight><bold>812</bold></highlight>, and the aft end of the supplementary deflector <highlight><bold>814</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is positioned spaced from the fore end of the second main deflector <highlight><bold>812</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. And, preferably there are a plurality of ribs <highlight><bold>818</bold></highlight> between the first main deflectors and the second main deflectors <highlight><bold>812</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>for preventing distortion, and more preferably concentric to the tub cover circumference. And, a portion of an outer rib may be cut away. The ribs <highlight><bold>818</bold></highlight> are fitted under the following reasons. The washing water passed over the main deflectors <highlight><bold>812</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>812</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>may cause a vortex between the first and the second main deflectors <highlight><bold>812</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>812</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, or may flow to the outlet of the main flow passage, to interfere the washing water flow in the main flow passage. Therefore, the ribs <highlight><bold>818</bold></highlight> are provided to confine the washing water between the first and second deflectors <highlight><bold>812</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>812</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>to some extent, for preventing interference to the washing water in the main flow passage. Thus, the tub cover is divided by the first main deflectors <highlight><bold>812</bold></highlight> and the second main deflectors <highlight><bold>812</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>into fixed intervals S. And, a space between the intervals S has a main flow passage W<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> formed by the main deflector <highlight><bold>812</bold></highlight> and a just prior supplementary deflector <highlight><bold>812</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, and a supplementary passage W<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> formed by the supplementary deflector <highlight><bold>812</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and the vertical deflector <highlight><bold>813</bold></highlight>. And, there is a space formed by the first main deflector <highlight><bold>812</bold></highlight> and an adjacent second main deflector <highlight><bold>812</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. Accordingly, when the inner tub rotates in a regular direction(a counter clockwise direction on the drawing), most of the washing water pumped to the tub cover is guided by the tub cover as shown in arrows of solid lines to be sprayed into the inner tub through the regular direction outlets P<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> with a minimum friction. Opposite to this, when the inner tub rotates in a reverse direction(a clockwise direction on the drawing), most of the washing water pumped to the tub cover is guided by the tub cover as shown in arrows of dotted lines to be sprayed into the inner tub through the reverse direction outlets P<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> with a minimum friction. Therefore, the eighth embodiment tub cover can cope with all the regular and reverse direction rotation, effectively. </paragraph> <paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> In the meantime, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 39, a</cross-reference> portion of the regular direction outlet P<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and the reverse direction outlet P<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>may be cut away to form an opening <highlight><bold>816</bold></highlight>, for minimizing the scattering of the washing water caused by the washing water hitting onto the vertical deflector <highlight><bold>813</bold></highlight>. In the meantime, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 40 and 41</cross-reference>, identical to the seventh embodiment, either the damping member <highlight><bold>815</bold></highlight> or the sloped portion <highlight><bold>817</bold></highlight> is provided for effective prevention of the washing water scattering. And, it is preferable that a sealing member is provided between the tub cover and the outer tub. </paragraph> <paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> As has been explained, the penetration type washing machine, the method for controlling the same, and the tub cover for the same have the following advantages. </paragraph> <paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> First, the penetration type washing machine can make washing using an appropriate combination of the penetration washing, the agitating washing, and the restoration circulation washing. Therefore, a washing efficiency can be improved while damage to, and entangling of the laundry is minimized. And, the washing can be carried out only with a small amount of washing water, consumption of water and detergent may be reduced, with consequential reduction of drain time period, to reduce an overall washing time. </paragraph> <paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> Second, the tub cover of the present invention can improve a pumping efficiency of the washing water because leakage or scattering of the pumped washing water can be prevented and the washing water can be guided into the inner tub without friction loss. And, the noise and foam caused by the circulated washing water at the high speed rotation of the inner tub can be minimized. </paragraph> <paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> Third, as the tub cover of the present invention facilitates spray of the pumped washing water toward a center of the inner tub, a washing efficiency can be improved. </paragraph> <paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications and variations can be made in the penetration type washing machine, the method for controlling the same, and the tub cover for the same of the present invention without departing from the spirit or scope of the invention. Thus, it is intended that the present invention cover the modifications and variations of this invention provided they come within the scope of the appended claims and their equivalents. </paragraph> <paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> The foregoing embodiments and advantages are merely exemplary and are not to be construed as limiting the present invention.

The method includes measuring an initial reflectance spectrum of a sample of the hair and analyzing a contribution of a plurality of natural hair factors to the initial reflectance spectrum. The method also includes calculating a hair treatment based on another reflectance spectrum. A system to measure a reflectance spectrum of a sample includes an integrating sphere having a sampling port and an inner surface and a window disposed near to the sampling port. The window is configured for being placed in close contact with the sample. The system also includes a light source configured to project light onto the sample via the window and a light detector configured to analyze light reflected from the inner surface to produce the reflectance spectrum of the sample. </paragraph> </subdoc-abstract> <subdoc-description> <cross-reference-to-related-applications> <paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This application claims priority from U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/392,055 filed Jun. 28, 2002.</paragraph> </cross-reference-to-related-applications> <summary-of-invention> <section> <heading lvl="1">FIELD AND BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading> <paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a hair treatment and, in particular, it concerns an apparatus to measure a hair reflectance spectrum and a method to determine an appropriate hair treatment based directly upon a hair reflectance spectrum. </paragraph> <paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> By way of introduction, each strand of hair consists of three layers, namely, the medulla, cortex and cuticle. The medulla is the innermost layer of the hair and is composed of a softer keratin-rich material and its occurrence in human hair appears to be variable, usually being present in large thick hairs. The cuticle is the outermost surface of the hair shaft and is composed of a very hard keratinous substance. It consists of flattened platelets of amorphous keratin, wrapped around the hair shaft in several layers, each layer overlapping the adjacent one, progressing from the root to the tip of the hair. Lastly, the cortex is the inner bulk of the hair, which forms the main body of the hair. The cortex is disposed between the medulla and the cuticle. It is composed of a much softer, fibrous, crystalline keratin. It provides strength, color and texture to the hair. Human hair gets its colors from specialized cells in the hair follicle called melanocytes that produce the pigment for hair. Humans normally produce two type of melanin, namely, Eumelanin and Pheomelanin. Eumelanin is associated with a dark brown color and Pheomelanin is associated with an orange color. Brown and black hair is given its color primarily by Eumelanin. Red hair is given its color primarily by Pheomelanin. Blond hair and hair that has gone white with age have very few of either pigment. </paragraph> <paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> A hair treatment to change an initial hair color to a final hair color normally involves bleaching and/or dyeing. The hair may need to be bleached to reduce the natural Eumelanin and Pheomelanin pigments. The extent of the bleaching depends upon the initial and final hair color. A diluted solution of hydrogen peroxide is generally used as the bleaching agent. The oxygen in the diluted solution of hydrogen peroxide opens up the cuticle of the hair so that the bleaching agent can enter into the cortex to remove the Eumelanin and Pheomelanin pigments. Once bleaching is complete, the hair dye is applied to the hair, if necessary. The hair dye also includes oxygen, which opens up the cuticle of the hair so that the coloring agent can enter into the cortex. </paragraph> <paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Therefore, the accuracy of the hair coloring process relies upon the skill of the hairdresser to determine how much bleaching is required and which hair dye or combination of hair dyes should be applied to provide the customer with the desired final color. Part of the hairdresser&apos;s skill is based upon accumulated experience as well as guidelines issued by the dye manufacturer. However, the final color is often a matter of surprise to both the hairdresser and the customer. </paragraph> <paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Of relevance to the present invention is U.S. Pat. No. 4,434,467 to Scott. The patent to Scott describes a method whereby the customer chooses a color from a database that is the closest match to his or her own hair color. The customer then chooses a desired final color from the database. The computer then suggests a treatment based on the manufacturer instructions. A shortcoming of the aforementioned system is that the customer has to determine by visual comparison, the closest match to his or her own hair color. A further shortcoming of the aforementioned system is that the system is limited to hair treatments, which are based upon a fixed selection of initial hair colors, thereby not taking into account the individual&apos;s hair color. </paragraph> <paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Also of relevance to the present invention is U.S. Pat. No. 5,609,484 to Hawiuk. Hawuik teaches the use of color filament swatches to recreate the initial hair color and then to add color filament swatches, which are related to a known hair dye, to see how the initial hair color is affected by the hair dye. A shortcoming of the aforementioned system is that the system is not accurate. A further shortcoming of the aforementioned system is that determining the initial color involves a high degree of estimation. An additional shortcoming of the aforementioned system is that this system does not address bleaching of the initial hair color. </paragraph> <paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Of most relevance to the present invention is U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,067,504, 6,157,445, 6,308,088, 6,314,372 and 6,330,341 to MacFarlane, et el. These patents discuss a method, which first includes obtaining a reflectance spectrum from a sample of hair. The coefficients of the Hunter L, a and b color coordinates of the reflectance spectrum of the hair sample are then analyzed by a computer. The initial hair color is then classified by the computer according to a range of coefficients of the color coordinates stored in a lookup table. A user then chooses a desired hair color from a choice of possible final colors. The computer then determines the appropriate hair treatment based upon a hair treatment stored in a lookup table for the initial hair color and the desired final hair color. A shortcoming of the aforementioned system is due to the initial hair color being classified according to an artificial color, which fits into a range of possible colors. Therefore, the suggested hair treatment does not accurately reflect the users initial hair color. A further shortcoming of the aforementioned system is that the creation and maintenance of the hair treatment lookup table requires a vast number of experiments. For example, for each hair dye, experiments are needed for all the possible initial and final hair colors that can be achieved for that dye. Additionally, the use of the L, a, b color coordinate system can be misleading in certain cases. For example, two samples of hair, which look substantially the same to the human eye may have the same L, a, b color coordinate values even though they have different spectrums of reflectance. For example, one natural blond hair sample which is colored with dye A, may have the same color coordinates as another hair sample, say, a brown hair colored with a dye B. Therefore, simply looking at the L, a, b color coordinates may lead to spurious results. </paragraph> <paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> There is therefore a need for a method to determine a hair treatment based directly upon a person&apos;s initial hair color. </paragraph> <paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Additionally, a large sample of hair is typically required to produce a usable reflectance spectrum of hair. Therefore, there is a need for a system and method to produce a usable reflectance spectrum of hair without having to remove the hair from the customer&apos;s head. </paragraph> </section> <section> <heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading> <paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The present invention is an apparatus to measure a hair reflectance spectrum and a method to determine an appropriate hair treatment based directly upon a hair reflectance spectrum. </paragraph> <paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> According to the teachings of the present invention there is provided, a method to change the color of hair, comprising the steps of: (a) measuring an initial reflectance spectrum of a sample of the hair;

It will be appreciated by persons skilled in the art that the present invention can also be applied to other applications including dyeing of fabrics and other materials. </paragraph> <paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> Reference is now made to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, which is a schematic view of a reflectance spectrum measurement system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> that is constructed and operable in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the invention. Reflectance spectrum measurement system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> includes a light-probing device, such as an integrating sphere <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> having a sampling port <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and an inner surface <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. Integrating sphere <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> are commonly used in many optical applications. Inner surface <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is coated with a substance, which enables inner surface <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> to exhibit very high diffusive reflectance properties, such as Beryllium Sulfate. A transparent window <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is disposed across sampling port <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> to prevent dirt, contaminants and other foreign substances from entering into integrating sphere <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Additionally and more importantly, window <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> also enables close contact between integrating sphere <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and a hair sample <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> by flattening hair sample <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. It is preferable for hair sample <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> to be flat during the measurement of the reflectance spectrum. Reflectance spectrum measurement system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> also includes a light source <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and a light detector <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. Light source <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is connected to integrating sphere <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> via an optical fiber <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. Light source <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> projects light onto hair sample <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> via window <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. Light detector <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is connected to integrating sphere <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> via an optical fiber <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. Light detector <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is typically a spectrophotometer. Light detector <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is configured to analyze light reflected from inner surface <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> to produce a reflectance spectrum of hair sample <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. In use, window <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> of integrating sphere <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is placed in close contact with attached hair, attached hair being hair which is still attached to the head. Light source <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> projects light onto hair sample <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> via window <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. Light then reflects off of hair sample <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> onto inner surface <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> via window <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. The light then exits integrating sphere <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> via optical fiber <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> to light detector <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. Light detector <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> then produces the reflectance spectrum of hair sample <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that light source <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and light detector <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> can be arranged in various orientations with respect to integrating sphere <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. It will also be apparent to those skilled in the art that integrating sphere <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> can be substituted by other light probing devices. Before reflectance spectrum measurement system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is used to measure a reflectance spectrum, reflectance spectrum measurement system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is calibrated by measuring the reflectance spectrum of a white reference material. The white reference material has very high reflectance properties and is typically packaged with integrating sphere <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Once this calibration measurement has been made, all future reflectance spectra are compared to the reflectance spectrum of the white reference material. Therefore, the typical reflectance spectrum of a sample is displayed as a graph of percentage reflectance (as compared to the white reflectance material) versus wavelength. </paragraph> <paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> By way of introduction, the present invention utilizes natural hair factors, such as Eumelanin, Pheomelanin and other factors which contribute to the reflectance spectra of hair to predict a final hair color based upon a hair treatment or to determine an appropriate hair treatment based upon a desired final hair color. </paragraph> <paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> Reference is now made to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, which is a chart of percentage reflectance against wavelength in nm showing the reflectance spectra of three factors contributing to the reflectance spectra of natural hair that is operable in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention. The inventors of the present invention measured the reflectance spectra of a large sample of natural hairs and bleached hairs and then performed factor analysis to determine the reflectance spectra of the natural hair factors that contribute to the reflectance spectra of hair. It was also found that bleaching does not add another factor to the reflectance spectrum of hair. Factor analysis is known to one skilled in the art of factor analysis. Additionally, factor analysis is described in the following publications. First, D. Noy, L. Fiedor, G. Hartwich, H. Scheer and A. Scherz (1998) Metal substituted bacteriochlorophylls; 2. Changes in redox potentials and electronic transition energies are dominated by intramolecular electrostatic interactions. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 120, 3684-3693. Second, Noy, R. Yerushalmi, V. Brumfeld, I Ashur, H. Scheer, Kim Baldridg and A. Scherz, (2000) Optical Absorption and Computational Studies of &lsqb;Ni&rsqb;-Bacteriochlorophyll-a. New Insight into charge Distribution between Metal and Ligands. J. Amer. Chem. Soc., 122 (16), 3937-3944 Malinowski, E. R. Factor Analysis in Chemistry; 2nd ed.; Wiley: 1991. The inventors initially performed their analysis assuming that the reflectance spectra of hair are due to three factors. The first natural hair factor, shown by curve <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, is due to the Eumelanin pigment in hair. The second natural hair factor, shown by curve <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, is due to the Pheomelanin pigment in hair. The third factor, shown by curve <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, is known as the white factor. The white factor is probably related to the characteristics of the keratin. The above three factors are the three main factors present in natural hair. The coefficients of the factors determine the reflectance spectrum for a particular hair. For example, a person with dark hair has a high coefficient of the Eumelanin factor and a person with red hair has a high coefficient of the Pheomelanin factor. The inventors extended their research assuming that the reflectance spectra of hair are due to four factors as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, which is a chart of percentage reflectance against wavelength in nm for four factors. In addition to the Eumelanin factor shown by curve <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and the Pheomelanin factor shown by curve <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and the white factor shown by curve <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, there is a fourth factor, shown by curve <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, which seems to relate to a consistent error of the apparatus used to measure the reflectance spectra. It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the error factor will depend on the type of apparatus being used. For each type of apparatus, the error factor can be determined using factor analysis. This can be done by assuming that only the error factor changes between apparatuses. Alternatively, all four factors can be recalculated for each type of apparatus. Alternatively, the error factor can be ignored and only three-factor analysis can be employed. The inventors additionally extended their research assuming that the reflectance spectra of hair are due to five factors. The inventors concluded that either three-factor analysis or four-factor analysis gives the best results. Table 1 shows the data points which can be used to recreate the reflectance spectrum for each factor for both three-factor analysis and four-factor analysis.   <table-cwu id="TABLE-US-00001">

</paragraph> <paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> Reference is now made to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, which is a flow chart of the steps involved in changing the color of hair in accordance with preferred embodiment of the invention. First, (block <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>) a customer chooses a desired hair color from a selection of possible hair colors. The possible hair color selection is typically created by measuring the reflectance spectrum for a large sample of different colored hairs. Each reflectance spectrum is then inputted into a computer. The computer uses the reflectance spectrum to recreate the actual color for displaying on a monitor. The displaying of a color on a monitor based upon a reflectance spectrum is known in the art. It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that the desired colors could be printed on a card or be represented as swatches of dyed hair. Therefore, each of the available colors has a known reflectance spectrum. Second, (block <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>) an initial reflectance spectrum of the customer&apos;s hair is measured by reflectance spectrum measurement system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Third, (block <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>) the contribution of the natural hair factors to the initial reflectance spectrum is analyzed by the computer. In other words, the coefficient of each natural factor contributing to the initial reflectance spectrum is determined by the computer, typically using a curve fitting program which performs iterative calculations based on the known natural hair factors and the initial reflectance spectrum. By way of a non-limiting example, instructions that can be used to write a computer program to perform coefficient analysis are given with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight>Fourth, (block <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>) the computer performs hypothetical calculations based upon hypothetical hair treatments to determine a hair treatment which results in a final reflectance spectrum which is as close as possible to the reflectance spectrum of the desired color. In this step, the computer calculates the change in the coefficients of each of the natural hair factors due to a hypothetical bleaching time and a hypothetical application of a dye or a combination of dyes. The effect of bleaching on the natural hair factors is described below in more detail with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight><highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b, </italic></highlight><highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c, </italic></highlight><highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e. </italic></highlight>The effect of dyeing on the natural hair factors using a dye which has a factor which is dissimilar to one of the natural hair factors is described below in more detail with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. The effect of dyeing on the natural hair factors using a dye which has a factor which is similar to one of the natural factors is described below in more detail with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>. Dyes that have a very high correlation with the natural hair factors of Eumelanin and Pheomelanin are described as natural hair factor dyes. Natural hair factor dyes can be used when the desired hair color is a natural hair color. When a dye is introduced, a new factor associated with that dye is typically introduced as well. After the computer calculates the new coefficients of the factors, the computer calculates a new reflectance spectrum (block <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>), based on the hypothetical hair treatment, by summing the new contribution of each factor. In other words, the computer calculates a new reflectance spectrum, based on the hypothetical hair treatment, by summing the products of the reflectance spectra of each factor and their associated coefficients. This new reflectance spectrum is then compared with the reflectance spectrum of the desired color (block <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>). The computer then performs many iterative calculations until the difference between the new reflectance spectrum and the desired reflectance spectrum is minimized, given the constraints of the iteration process and the available dyes. An exact match is generally not possible due to the constraint of the available dyes. In other words, the computer calculates a hair treatment based on the desired reflectance spectrum given the constraints of the iteration process and the available dyes. It should be noted that if the desired hair color is a natural hair color, then dyeing using synthetic dyes may not be needed, bleaching may be enough. Likewise, if a customer has light colored hair, bleaching may not be necessary to achieve the desired color. Fifth, (block <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>) after the computer has completed the iterative calculations, the computer displays the colors of a selected number of possible final hair colors. The possible final hair colors generally include the closest match to the desired hair color as well as several other colors, which are a set gap from the desired color. The set gap can be preset by the hairdresser. Sixth, (block <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>) the customer chooses one of the available final hair colors. Seventh, (block <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>) the computer informs the hairdresser of the required bleaching time and dyes needed to achieve the chosen color. Eighth, (block <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>) if bleaching is required, the hairdresser bleaches the hair for the required time. Ninth, (block <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> optionally at this stage, steps two to seven (line <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>), or steps one to seven (line <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>), are performed again, before dyeing to achieve more accurate dyeing results. Tenth, (block <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>) if dyeing is being performed, the hairdresser dyes the hair using a dye or a combination thereof. It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that other methods using the technology of the present invention are possible. For example, the above steps may be performed in a different order. Also, the customer could be given a number of hair color choices based on the use of a specific dye with differing bleaching times. </paragraph> <paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> By way of introduction, the inventors have proven by experimentation that the factors of unbleached natural hair are very similar to the factors of bleached hair. Additionally, the inventors have proven that a bright natural hair has substantially the same coefficients of factors as a dark hair that has been bleached to the same color as the bright natural hair. Additionally, the bleaching process is mainly reducing the Eumelanin&apos;s concentration within the hair, but the pigments of Pheomelanin are also being removed. Reference is now made to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight>which is a graph showing the weight of Eumelanin against effective bleaching time. The following analysis was performed using 4-factor analysis. However, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that the following analysis can be performed for any number of factors. The weight of Eumelanin is given by the following formula:   <math-cwu id="MATH-US-00001"> <number>1</number> <math> <mtable>   <mtr>     <mtd>       <mrow>         <mrow>           <msub>             <mi>W</mi>             <mi>EU</mi>           </msub>           <mo>=</mo>           <mfrac>             <msub>               <mi>C</mi>               <mi>EU</mi>             </msub>             <mrow>               <msub>                 <mi>C</mi>                 <mi>EU</mi>               </msub>               <mo>+</mo>               <msub>                 <mi>C</mi>                 <mi>PH</mi>               </msub>               <mo>+</mo>               <msub>                 <mi>C</mi>                 <mi>W</mi>               </msub>               <mo>+</mo>               <msub>                 <mi>C</mi>                 <mi>ER</mi>               </msub>             </mrow>           </mfrac>         </mrow>         <mo>,</mo>       </mrow>     </mtd>     <mtd>       <mstyle>         <mtext>(Equation&nbsp;&nbsp;1)</mtext>       </mstyle>     </mtd>   </mtr> </mtable> </math> <mathematica-file id="MATHEMATICA-00001" file="US20040000015A1-20040101-M00001.NB"/> <image id="EMI-M00001" wi="216.027" he="18.96615" file="US20040000015A1-20040101-M00001.TIF" imf="TIFF" ti="MF"/> </math-cwu> </paragraph> <paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> where W<highlight><subscript>EU </subscript></highlight>is the weight of the Eumelanin factor, C<highlight><subscript>EU </subscript></highlight>is the coefficient of the Eumelanin factor, C<highlight><subscript>PH </subscript></highlight>is the coefficient of the Pheomelanin factor, C<highlight><subscript>W </subscript></highlight>is the coefficient of the white factor and C<highlight><subscript>ER </subscript></highlight>is the coefficient of the error factor. If three-factor analysis is used, the error factor is ignored. Similarly, the weights of the other factors are calculated with respect to the coefficients of all the factors. The graph of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>was produced by performing the following steps. A reflectance spectrum of a sample of hair was measured and then W<highlight><subscript>EU </subscript></highlight>was calculated. The sample of hair was then bleached for a specific time. The same sample of hair was then additionally bleached again and W<highlight><subscript>EU </subscript></highlight>was recalculated. The same hair was then re-bleached and W<highlight><subscript>EU </subscript></highlight>was recalculated a number of times. This same process was repeated for a number of hair samples. The bleaching substance used is a mixture of 50% water, 25% Mon-platin Blondy hair bleaching powder and 25% Mon-platin 12% oxygen cream, by weight. The bleaching substance is manufactured by Alef Meshi Industries Ltd., 4 Pinkas David Street, Rishon Le-Zion, Israel. Equations 2 to 6, which are listed below are based on experiments performed with the abovementioned bleaching substance. A new reflectance spectrum was measured and W<highlight><subscript>EU </subscript></highlight>was recalculated. All the sequences were merged into a single graph by supplying the appropriate time-shift for each sequence of dots for each hair sample. For example, a hair sample having an initial weight of the Eumelanin factor 0.6 starts at an effective time of approximately 30 minutes (line <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>), another hair sample having an initial weight of the Eumelanin factor of 0.4 starts at an effective time of approximately 57 minutes (line <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>). Therefore, by way of example, if a hair sample has an initial W<highlight><subscript>EU </subscript></highlight>of 0.6 and the hair sample is bleached for 70 minutes, the hair sample will have a final W<highlight><subscript>EU </subscript></highlight>of approximately 0.2. This is because the hair sample has an effective start time of 30 minutes and an effective end time of 100 minutes. Additionally, by way of example, if another hair sample has an initial weight of Eumelanin of 0.4, this hair sample has an effective start time of approximately 57 minutes. If this hair sample needs to be bleached to have a weight of Eumelanin of 0.2, which is equivalent to an end time of 100 minutes, then the hair sample needs to be bleached for 43 minutes (100 minutes less 57 minutes). The equation of the graph of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>was then calculated using a best-fit method. The equation of the graph of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is:</paragraph> <paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula><highlight><italic>W</italic></highlight><highlight><subscript>EU</subscript></highlight>&equals;2.3421&times;10<highlight><superscript>&minus;5</superscript></highlight><highlight><italic>t</italic></highlight><highlight><subscript>EU</subscript></highlight><highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>&minus;0.0089<highlight><italic>t</italic></highlight><highlight><subscript>EU</subscript></highlight>&plus;0.8455&emsp;&emsp;(Equation 2),</in-line-formula></paragraph> <paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> where t<highlight><subscript>EU </subscript></highlight>is the effective bleaching time in minutes for the Eumelanin factor. Equation 2 is valid for any hair sample using the abovementioned bleaching solution. However, it will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, that equation 2 can be recalculated by performing limited experiments using another bleaching substance on a sample of hairs. In order to determine the appropriate equations for another bleaching substance, the samples for used should be from natural unbleached hairs. Hair samples from at least five individuals should be used. Each sample of hair from the same individual should be divided into several smaller samples so that each smaller sample can be bleached for a different duration of time. This procedure is repeated for each individual. All the results are merged together into the same graph by supplying the appropriate time shift to each series of points from each individual. The samples used should be chosen such that, the samples give a large spread over the range of possible natural hair colors (from bright hair to dark hair). The total number of points on the graph should be at least 15. It should be noted that only the constants of equation 2 change with different bleaching substances. </paragraph> <paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> Similarly, the Pheomelanin factor also decreases due to bleaching. However, when a reflectance spectrum is measured and the coefficients of the reflectance spectrum are analyzed, the coefficient and therefore the weight of the Pheomelanin factor only represent the Pheomelanin that is in the background of the Eumelanin. In other words, the dark nature of the Eumelanin pigment prevents a portion of the Pheomelanin factor from contributing to the reflectance spectrum. Therefore, the coefficient and weight of the Pheomelanin factor which are calculated using the analysis of the reflectance spectrum only represent a &ldquo;background&rdquo; value. Similarly, the coefficient and weight of the white factor which are calculated using the analysis of the reflectance spectrum only represent a &ldquo;background&rdquo; value with respect to the foreground Eumelanin. Therefore, W<highlight><subscript>PH&minus;B</subscript></highlight>, which is the weight of the Pheomelanin factor in the background is given by the following equation:   <math-cwu id="MATH-US-00002"> <number>2</number> <math> <mtable>   <mtr>     <mtd>       <mrow>         <msub>           <mi>W</mi>           <mrow>             <mi>PH</mi>             <mo>-</mo>             <mi>B</mi>           </mrow>         </msub>         <mo>=</mo>         <mrow>           <mfrac>             <msub>               <mi>C</mi>               <mi>PH</mi>             </msub>             <mrow>               <msub>                 <mi>C</mi>                 <mi>PH</mi>               </msub>               <mo>+</mo>               <msub>                 <mi>C</mi>                 <mi>W</mi>               </msub>               <mo>+</mo>               <msub>                 <mi>C</mi>                 <mi>ER</mi>               </msub>             </mrow>           </mfrac>           <mo>.</mo>         </mrow>       </mrow>     </mtd>     <mtd>       <mstyle>         <mtext>(Equation&nbsp;&nbsp;3)</mtext>       </mstyle>     </mtd>   </mtr> </mtable> </math> <mathematica-file id="MATHEMATICA-00002" file="US20040000015A1-20040101-M00002.NB"/> <image id="EMI-M00002" wi="216.027" he="18.96615" file="US20040000015A1-20040101-M00002.TIF" imf="TIFF" ti="MF"/> </math-cwu> </paragraph> <paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> The bleaching analysis performed for the Eumelanin factor with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>was also performed with respect to the Pheomelanin factor and the white factor.

However, when the cuticle of the hair is open more than average or closed more than average, the hair is bleached quicker or slower, respectively, and therefore requires less or more bleaching time, respectively. Therefore, the above formulas need to be adjusted for any change in bleaching time due to the condition of the cuticle. It is estimated that the bleaching time needs to be adjusted between 5% and 50% due to the status of the cuticle. Experienced hairdressers are skilled in the art of detecting inferior quality hair, which is associated with the status of the cuticle. </paragraph> <paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> By way of introduction, dyeing hair generally alters the weights of the natural hair factors as well as adding a new factor of the dye itself. The final weight of the dye is a function of the sum of the changes of the weights of the natural hair factors, as shown by the following equation:</paragraph> <paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula><highlight><italic>W</italic></highlight><highlight><subscript>DYE&minus;F</subscript></highlight>&equals;&fnof;(&Dgr;<highlight><italic>W</italic></highlight><highlight><subscript>EU</subscript></highlight><highlight><italic>&plus;&Dgr;W</italic></highlight><highlight><subscript>PH</subscript></highlight><highlight><italic>&plus;&Dgr;W</italic></highlight><highlight><subscript>W</subscript></highlight><highlight><italic>&plus;&Dgr;W</italic></highlight><highlight><subscript>ER</subscript></highlight>)&emsp;&emsp;(Equation 10),</in-line-formula></paragraph> <paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> where W<highlight><subscript>DYE&minus;F </subscript></highlight>is the final weight of the dye, &Dgr;W<highlight><subscript>EU </subscript></highlight>is the change in the Eumelanin factor due to dyeing, &Dgr;W<highlight><subscript>PH </subscript></highlight>is the change in the Pheomelanin factor due to dyeing, &Dgr;W<highlight><subscript>W </subscript></highlight>is the change in the white factor due to dyeing and &Dgr;W<highlight><subscript>ER </subscript></highlight>is the change in the error factor due to dyeing. For the sake of clarification, &Dgr;W<highlight><subscript>EU </subscript></highlight>is equal to the final weight of the Eumelanin factor less the initial weight of the Eumelanin factor. Similarly, all the changes in weights and coefficients of the various factors are defined as the final value less the initial value of the weight or coefficient of the factor concerned. It should be noted that the effect of the change in the weight of the error factor on the weight of the dye is generally negligible and can be ignored. Moreover, if three-factor analysis is used the error factor is also ignored. The weight difference of the Eumelanin factor is correlated with the change in the coefficient of the white factor divided by the initial weight of the weight factor among the background. This is illustrated by the following equation:   <math-cwu id="MATH-US-00005"> <number>5</number> <math> <mtable>   <mtr>     <mtd>       <mrow>         <mrow>           <mrow>             <mi>&Delta;</mi>             <mo>&it;</mo>             <mstyle>               <mtext>&emsp;</mtext>             </mstyle>             <mo>&it;</mo>             <msub>               <mi>W</mi>               <mi>EU</mi>             </msub>           </mrow>           <mo>=</mo>           <mrow>             <mi>f</mi>             <mo>&af;</mo>             <mrow>               <mo>(</mo>               <mfrac>                 <mrow>                   <mi>&Delta;</mi>                   <mo>&it;</mo>                   <mstyle>                     <mtext>&emsp;</mtext>                   </mstyle>                   <mo>&it;</mo>                   <msub>                     <mi>C</mi>                     <mi>W</mi>                   </msub>                 </mrow>                 <msub>                   <mi>W</mi>                   <mrow>                     <mi>W</mi>                     <mo>-</mo>                     <mi>i</mi>                     <mo>-</mo>                     <mi>B</mi>                   </mrow>                 </msub>               </mfrac>               <mo>)</mo>             </mrow>           </mrow>         </mrow>         <mo>,</mo>       </mrow>     </mtd>     <mtd>       <mstyle>         <mtext>(Equation&nbsp;&nbsp;11)</mtext>       </mstyle>     </mtd>   </mtr> </mtable> </math> <mathematica-file id="MATHEMATICA-00005" file="US20040000015A1-20040101-M00005.NB"/> <image id="EMI-M00005" wi="216.027" he="18.96615" file="US20040000015A1-20040101-M00005.TIF" imf="TIFF" ti="MF"/> </math-cwu> </paragraph> <paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> where &Dgr;C<highlight><subscript>W </subscript></highlight>is the change in the coefficient of the white factor due to dyeing and W<highlight><subscript>W&minus;i&minus;B </subscript></highlight>is the initial weight of the white factor among the background. </paragraph> <paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> Additionally the final weight of the dye factor is highly correlated with the final coefficient of the dye factor.

Therefore, it can be seen that limited experimentation for each dye or a combination of dyes can be performed using a number of hair samples to determine the functions of equations 10 to 14 for each dye or combination of dyes. The limited experimentation involves calculating the coefficients and weights of all the factors before and after dyeing. The results are then plotted on suitable graphs and the functions of equations 10 to 14 are determined by the equations of the slope of the graphs. For example, the function of equation 10 is determined by plotting a graph of W<highlight><subscript>DYE&minus;F </subscript></highlight>against (&Dgr;W<highlight><subscript>EU</subscript></highlight>&plus;&Dgr;W<highlight><subscript>PH</subscript></highlight>&plus;&Dgr;W<highlight><subscript>W</subscript></highlight>&plus;&Dgr;W<highlight><subscript>ER</subscript></highlight>). The determined equations, for a specific dye, or combination of dyes are used to predict the change on the reflectance spectrum by applying the dye or combination of dyes, as will be explained with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. The hair samples should be from natural unbleached hairs. Hair samples from at least five individuals should be used. Each sample of hair from the same individual should be divided into several smaller samples so that each smaller sample can be bleached for a different duration of time. Each sample is then dyed. This procedure is repeated for each individual. The samples used should be chosen such that, the samples give a large spread over the range of possible natural hair colors (from bright hair to dark hair). The total number of points on each graph should be at least 15. It is advisable to apply the dye according to the manufacturer instructions using the correct concentrations and waiting times. If the manufacturer instructions are not followed, the dye needs to be applied consistently to ensure that results obtained are meaningful. When a combination of dyes is used the proportions of each dye needs to be carefully maintained. </paragraph> <paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> The factor of the dye or combination of dyes is determined by two methods. The first method involves dyeing white hair with the chosen dye or combination of dyes. A reflectance spectrum of the dye or combination of dyes is measured and factor analysis is performed to identify the new factor associated with the chosen dye or combination of dyes. White hair is preferred as the coefficients of the Eumelanin and Pheomelanin factors are very small and the factor analysis is quicker. The second method includes placing a thick dried droplet of dye or combination of dyes on window <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> of reflectance spectrum measurement system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>). The reflectance spectrum of the thick droplet of dye or combination of dyes only contains the contribution of the factor of the chosen dye or combination of dyes and therefore the factor of the dye or combination of dyes is easily identified. </paragraph> <paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> By way of a non-limiting example, experiments were performed using the WELLA KOLESTON 305/0 Light-Brown dye. This dye is produced by Wella AG, Berliner Allee 65, 64274 Darmstadt, Germany. The dye was applied in accordance with the manufacturer instructions. The color tube was packaged with an oxygen cream. The entire contents of the color tube and oxygen cream were mixed together to form the dye. The following equations, based on equations 10 to 14, are valid for the abovementioned dye:   <math-cwu id="MATH-US-00006"> <number>6</number> <math> <mtable>   <mtr>     <mtd>       <mrow>

is a flow chart of the steps involved in determining the effects of dyeing on the reflectance spectrum of hair. First, if bleaching is to be performed the final weights after bleaching are used as the initial weights before dyeing. If bleaching is not performed or actual bleaching has already been performed on the customer&apos;s hair, a new reflectance spectrum is measured and the coefficients and weights of the new reflectance spectrum are analyzed and calculated, respectively (block <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight>). Second, final coefficient of the white factor is calculated using equation 14 (block <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight>). Third, the final weight of the Eumelanin factor, after dyeing, is calculated using equation 11 (block <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>). Fourth, the final weight of the Pheomelanin factor, after dyeing, is calculated using equation 13 (block <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>).

This is because the very high resemblance between the dye and one of the natural hair factors requires a very high resolution during the searching process of the curve fitting program to be enable identification of the coefficients of the dye factor and the closely matched natural hair factor. Therefore, another method is needed to predict the effect on the reflectance spectrum of hair due to dyeing, where the dye factor has a very close resemblance to one of the natural hair factors. </paragraph> <paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> One method is to merge the final weight of the dye factor and the closest natural hair factor.

Therefore, it can be seen that limited experimentation for each dye or combination of dyes can be performed using a number of hair samples to determine the functions of equations 20 to 23 for each dye or combination of dyes, as described above with reference to equations 10 to 14. The limited experimentation involves calculating the coefficients and weights of all the factors before and after dyeing. The results are then plotted on suitable graphs and the functions of equations 20 to 23 are determined by the equations of the slope of the graphs. The determined equations, for a specific dye or combination of dyes, are used to predict the change on the reflectance spectrum by applying the dye or combination of dyes, as will be explained with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>. It is advisable to apply the dye according to the manufacturer instructions using the correct concentrations and waiting times. If the manufacturer instructions are not followed, the dye needs to be applied consistently to ensure that results obtained are meaningful. When a combination of dyes is used the proportions of each dye needs to be carefully maintained. </paragraph> <paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> By way of a non-limiting example, experiments were performed using the WELLA KOLESTON 307/64 Cherry dye manufactured by Wella AG.

The entire contents of the color tube and oxygen cream were mixed together to form the dye.

Natural hair factor dyes are used when the desired final color is a natural hair color. Limited experiments are performed with different proportions of the natural hair factor dyes to determine the dyeing equations for these different proportions. The computer calculates a hair treatment by performing iterative calculations using the equations for the different proportions of the natural hair dyes. It is advantageous to use natural hair factor dyes, as a new factor is not introduced into the hair by the dyeing process. Therefore, the computer iteration process is quicker. Then the natural hair factor dyes can be used to dye hair to a natural hair color. </paragraph> <paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> Reference is flow made to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight>which is a flow chart of an algorithm to enable a programmer to write a program to perform coefficient analysis.
